            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>Italian Bread</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Provolone Cheese</li>
                <li>Tomato Basil</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;This meal is a nice, very simple meal, probably the simplest on this list. To get started, take a stick of butter and place it in a separate bowl. Take 2 or 3 cloves of garlic (depending on how garlic-y you'd like your sandwich to taste) and mix it into the bowl with the butter. Once it is as mixed as it can be, take a piece of that Italian bread and wipe some garlic butter onto it. Place the bread, butter side down, in a pan. As the pan is warming up, take the cheese and place it onto the bread, and top off the sandwich with another slice of bread with a buttered side facing up. As the cheese starts to melt, flip the sandwich over and get that side to a nice brown burn, if the other slice still needs some cooking, you can flip the sandwich over for an extra 20 seconds or so and it will become just as nicely tanned as the top. At that point, remove the sandwich from the pan and place onto a plate. While the sandwich is on the pan, before its first flip, take a little bit of tomato basil and place it into a bowl. Microwave the basil, covered, for about 43 seconds. When both are warmedtake the sandwich and cut it in half and dip it into the basil. That's it, so easy to make, and so easy to enjoy!</p>
