            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
                <li>Turmeric</li>
                <li>Curry Powder</li>
                <li>Paprika</li>
                <li>Plain Greek Yogurt</li>
                <li>Red Onion</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;Start with cutting up the chicken breasts and placing in a bag. Take the paprika, turmeric, garam masala, pepper, salt, and Greek yogurt and put it in the bag with the chicken. Mix all of the ingredients well and let sit for 8-24 hours in the fridge.</p>
            <p>&emsp;When the chicken is fully marinated, place the chicken in a pan and cook out all of the juices until it is a normal consistency for eating. This should help the flavors soak into the chicken as well as making the chicken safe to eat. Next, take the chicken out of the pan, chop up the onions and place them in the pan with the tomatoes and some yogurt. Mix these together as they are cooking to make it a more uniform substance. Add in the spices again along with some butter and mix together again. This will be the sauce for the chicken.</p>
            <p>&emsp;When the sauce is ready, add the chicken back into the pan and continue to cook them both together for about 10 more minutes and then mix together. Once it is cooked to your preference, scoop out the chicken onto a plate, scoop up some sauce and pour it on top of the chicken and enjoy!</p>
