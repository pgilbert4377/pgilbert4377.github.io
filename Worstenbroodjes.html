            <h2>Ingredients for Dough:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>2 cups Flour</li>
                <li>1 cup Milk</li>
                <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Butter</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Yeast</li>
                <li>1 Egg</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Ingredients for Filling:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>3 cups Half and Half Cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Panko</li>
                <li>"A fair amount" Salt</li>
                <li>"A fair amount" Pepper</li>
                <li>"A pinch" Nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Paprika</li>
                <li>"A good splash" Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                <li>2 Eggs</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons Sambal Oelek</li>
                <li>2 Teaspoons Mustard</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;The first step is to add all of the ingredients for the dough into a bowl except for the butter. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes, slowly adding in more butter the more you knead it to balance the placement of the butter. Next cut the dough up into 20 equal pieces, and roll them into balls on a tray. Cover them up with a towel and leave to rise for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>&emsp;While the dough is rising, mix everything for the filling into a bowl and knead until it is a uniform mixture. Roll out 20 equal pieces of the filling into sausage-like pieces and when that is finished, the dough should have had enough time to rise.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Grab the dough, roll the balls flat, and place the sausage on top of them. Wrap up the dough to make sure the filling is completely covered by the dough. Place the rolls onto a pan, seam-side down, and align them to fit in a pan with equal space between them. Let them rise covered again for an hour.</p>
            <p>&emsp;After the dough is done rising, you can add a beaten egg to a bowl, and brush it on top of each of the rolls to give it a nice golden-brown look after it bakes. Once all of the rolls are ready, bake them until they are a nice and puffy and perfectly browned. Let cool, and enjoy!</p>
