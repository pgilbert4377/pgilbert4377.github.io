            <p>&emsp;My name is Peter Gilbert. I have been eating food since 2004, so one might say I am an expert in this field. In my early years, I had very little experience in the kitchen. I could make sandwiches for my lunches, make dips by mixing 2 ingredients, and eventually developed the responsibility to handle pushing buttons on the oven. Evey time my parents decided to go out for the night, my brother and I were left to fend for ourselves for dinner, usually mac and cheese with chicken nuggets, but after years of that, it got somewhat repetitive. However, I am of the lazy nature, and never was motivated enough to try to make anything other than simple oven meals whenever my parents had left. That is, until I got to college.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Going to college has affected my eating habits significantly. I now have the buffet-style meals, that don't prompt a return for seconds, or microwaveable foods. Luckily, I had access to an air fryer in my sophomore year, so the microwaveable meals were at least a little more enjoyable, but it still wasn't the same as homemade cooking that I longed for. Eventually, I tried experimenting with my ability to cook, starting with simple quesadillas and eggs (not in the same meal) at home, and eventually made quesadillas in the airfryer at college (when I wasn't munching on a Cook Out quesadilla).</p>
            <p>&emsp;The summer going into my junior year changed everything for me. My parents went to England for 3 weeks, and my brother had already moved out and was living in a different state, so I had been left to make dinners for myself, by myself. I started from boxed meals, and worked my way to making more complex (and more tasty) foods and desserts. Since then, I have been making foods on my free weekends with my friend from the Netherlands (which is why there are a few crazy named foods). This is the archives of (most of) those meals.</p>
