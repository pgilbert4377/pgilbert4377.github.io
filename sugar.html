            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie Mix</li>
                <li>1 Stick Butter</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons Light Brown Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>1 Egg</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Flour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;Start by getting out a stainless steel pan. Split the butter stick in half and place it on the pan. Keep the heat on low-medium heat until butter starts forming bubbles, stirring it the whole time. Lower the heat on the pan, and watch the butter as it is cooking. Continue stirring with the heat until you smell a nutty-like smell, and use the spoon to check that the butter is a light brown underneath the foam. When it is ready, pour in a bowl.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Next, pre-heat the oven to 325&deg;F and add the brown sugar and vanilla extract to the bowl and mix until it is one solution. Then, you want to add the rest of the butter, the egg, the flour, and the Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie Mix, and mix well until it is all combined.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Place the dough (your choice for the size of balls) on a pan with plenty of space for them to expand on the tray. The oven should be at temparture by the time you have laid out all of the dough balls, so place the dough into the oven and bake them for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool when they are finished baking and enjoy!</p>
