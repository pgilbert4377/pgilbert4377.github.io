            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>2 Tortillas</li>
                <li>1 1/2 slices of Deli Honey Ham</li>
                <li>Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&emsp;This is a very simple recipe. It is meant to be a very quick and easy meal to make, so there is not much to it.</p>
            <p>&emsp;To start, get out a pan and warm it up. Place a tortilla on the pan and sprinkle on some cheese. Rip up some honey ham slices and place the pieces throughout the tortilla. Add more cheese on top and cover with a second tortilla. Wait for the cheese to melt a little so that the tortillas are stuck together. Flip the tortilla over and let it cook a little bit longer until both sides are golden brown. Take it out of the pan when it's ready and cut into pieces. You can also add something to dip the quesadilla in, I like to eat it with some barbecue sauce. An alternative way to make this is to simply make it with just cheese, and my dipping choice for those is a mix of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole, but, to each their own. Enjoy!</p>
